- To get a call for an interview from BARC, a candidate must meet the cut-off criteria marks either through their GATE score or through the Online BARC test.

# Online Test Pattern 📝
- 100 MCQ questions (NO MSQs, NO NATs)
- 120 minutes 
- 300 marks 

Generally, it is observed that scoring around 150 is sufficient to clear the cut-off. **That means attempting 50 questions correctly.** 🎯

# Syllabus 📚
- All 12 GATE subjects
- Java 
- C++ 
- Software Engineering 
- Other CSE subjects like Network Security, Image Processing, Web Technology, etc. (The weightage is very low for these subjects.)
- Aptitude is **not tested here**. 🚫

# Preparation Strategy 🚀
> [!tip] Most of the questions will be direct and formula-based. Lengthy or confusing questions are avoided, as they know there is less time to solve 100 questions.

### GATE Subjects 📖
1. Revise your notes.
2. Practice formula-based GATE PYQs.
3. You can avoid hard 2-marker questions while practicing.

### Java ☕

### Software Engineering 🏗️

   - Note: Watching a YouTuber's playlist for this subject is not that worth it.
   - Instead, read [this](https://www.tpointtech.com/software-engineering) blog. It will save a lot of time.

### Other Subjects 📁
- If you are limited on time, then I would suggest skipping these topics. (The weightage is very low, based on previous paper patterns.)
- If you have spare time, you can go through your college notes and PPTs.
  
## Practice 💪
- Before starting the actual CBT test, there will be a small 10-minute demo test to familiarize you with the system interface.
  - Check how the calculator is accessible. (The calculator's interface is exactly the same as in the GATE exam.)
- To get mentally prepared for the timing, I gave the ACE Engineering Academy [BARC mock tests](https://www.aceenggacademy.com/barc-online-test-series/).
  - The ACE mocks contain only GATE syllabus questions.
  - My average score on all 5 **mocks** was 160. (I secured 159 in the **BARC CBT** test, so it's close.)
  - Currently, there are no other options for mocks.

### How to Attempt the Test? 🤔
> [!abstract] This can vary from person to person. Do what suits you.
- It's not like the GATE exam. Here, time is the main constraint.
- So, there is a high chance that you will not be able to apply a 2-pass attempt strategy.
- Read the question. If it is doable within 60 to 90 seconds, do it; otherwise, move to the next one.
  - By the time you reach the 100th question, there will hardly be any time left to check all your attempts. Thus, it is better to try some unattempted one-liner questions.
