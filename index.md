Hi guys! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jaydipsinh Zala, currently working as a BARC TSO.

I have a habit of noting everything down in a structured way. So, I'm creating this blog to share all my notes, which I hope will be helpful to you. I've already shared my GATE and BARC preparation material. ðŸ“š

I recently started reading - - - books. Stay tuned to get notes on those as well! âœ¨
