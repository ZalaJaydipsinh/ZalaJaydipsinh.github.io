# My Opinion 🤔

Look, I've seen toppers from Go Classes, PW, Gate @ Zeal, Unacademy, and other academies, and even self-learned toppers. So, there's no such thing as an absolute BEST. 🏆

I've studied from PW's 2024 batch and GO Classes' 2025 batch. Thus, I can compare these two **based on that content**. 🧑‍🏫

### PW 2024

The quality of content was at a college exam level. Only some topics by a few teachers were exceptionally well taught. ✨
i.e.,
- IP addressing & Routing protocols by Ankit Doyla Sir. 🌐
- Practice questions on pointers & recursion by Pankaj Sir. 💻
- CPU architecture by Vijay Agarwal Sir. 🖥️

### GO Classes

Completing the content was a huge challenge for me, even though I was preparing full-time. But I have to admit that by watching those proof lectures, my problem-solving skills improved. 📈 I really enjoyed the content.

See, guys, I don't want to confuse you by listing all the academies and their pros and cons. Whichever is financially suitable for you will work. Don't waste your time finding the best institute by watching hours of YouTube videos. ⏳

If your goal is to learn concepts correctly, you will achieve it. There are enough free resources. Also, don't forget to use ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity... . It used to take me days to search library books and internet pages to understand the intuition behind a topic. But now, it can be done within seconds. So, start your preparation with the correct intention. 🚀
