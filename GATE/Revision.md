Going through notes might be too time-consuming and overwhelming. 😨

You might need to revise a topic 10 times for it to really stick. 🧠 Short notes play a crucial role here! 📝

I'm attaching some demos of how I compressed two book's worth of notes into 10 pages of short notes, without losing the intuitive explanations. 👇

I used [this](https://amzn.in/d/7CeCYY4) type of file to store all my subject notes in one place. 📂

**Taking tests is more beneficial than revising the same content repeatedly.** 💯

* Revision will be very helpful during the last months of your preparation. 🗓️
* You won't need to search everywhere on your PC and at home just to revise some important formulas. 🔍
* A single file with all the important notes will be a lifesaver then! ✨

That's it, guys! Nothing complicated to follow. Hermann Ebbinghaus's spaced repetition might become too hectic to follow for GATE content, so don't pressure yourself if you can't adhere to that. 🙏
