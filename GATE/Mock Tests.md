The GATE exam features more calculation-based questions than direct theory-based ones. Thus, **practicing becomes more important than simply revising the same notes repeatedly.** Developing the ability to handle a variety of questions comes from consistent practice. 🚀

# When & What to Practice? 🕰️

After learning a particular concept or subject:
1.  Give **topic and subject-wise tests.** 🧠
2.  Practice **GATE PYQs (Previous Year Questions).** 📖

After following these steps, maintain a **short note containing newly learned topics and important points** from those tests.
* The reason to maintain this is `you'll have a centralized note where all your learnings are written.`
* It becomes very handy to revise from a single notebook. (Your mind can easily visualize a single source of knowledge.) 💡

# Which Platform Provides the Best Test Series? 🏆

The best test series provides:
* **Standard questions** ✅
* **Very rare question mistakes** 🎯
* **Same timing window as GATE** ⏰
* **A discussion forum for all questions** 💬
* **A fair comparison & analytical chart** 📊

I used the following test series during my preparation:

* ***Gate Overflow***
    * **Best Test Series.** (Must Try!) ⭐
    * Covers the overall syllabus.
    * Tests are built at the GATE level. 📈
* **Go Classes**
    * Good test series. 👍
    * Non-Go Classes students might find it a bit difficult.
    * Contains standard resource questions.
* **Gate@zeal**
    * Test duration is too low. (It spoils the meaning of a MOCK test.) 👎
    * Contains too many errors. (Also lacks good support from the team).
    * No student discussion forum.
    * No good explanations for the questions. ❌
* **Made Easy & PW**
    * Easy test series.
    * Not up to the GATE level. 📉
    * No good explanations.
    * No good support from the team. 🙁

# Notion Template 🚀

> [!Tip] During my preparation, I created a Notion template to maintain all my tests, PYQ progress, doubts, and To-Dos. [Have a look!](https://jayu.notion.site/bded0e7d2768489a83dba352db1f8f3b?v=744f5dbfadd64155b555b6ad623516af&source=copy_link)
